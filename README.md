### 👨‍💻 About Me:
I’m a Software Engineer who loves to untangle infrastructure challenges as much as I love untangling my golden retriever’s leash from the furniture. 🐾
- 🔭 I'm currently working as a Sr. Software Engineer at [Bitstop](https://bitstop.co/).
- 🎓 Graduated with an M.S. in Computer Science from Georgia Tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about kernel development.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on the Linux kernel.
- ⚡ Fun fact: “Why are my golden retriever and my two kids so alike? They only understand my commands when there’s food involved!”
